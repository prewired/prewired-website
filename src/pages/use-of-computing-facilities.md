"Computing facilities" includes remote computing services as provided on behalf of Prewired; computers and peripherals owned by or operated on behalf of Prewired; any associated software and data; and the networking elements which link computing facilities.

"Users" include members of the Board of Trustees, volunteers, paid staff, and any other person authorised to use computing facilities.

Prewired computing facilities should be used exclusively for supporting the charitable purposes of Prewired.

## Compliance with UK civil and criminal law

Users must comply with the provisions of all current applicable UK or Scots law, including but not restricted to:

* Intellectual property law, including laws concerning copyright, trademarks, and patents;
* The Computer Misuse Act 1990, and associated instruments; and
* Data protection laws.

Users must also comply with the terms of any licence agreement between Prewired and a third party which governs the use of hardware, software or access to data.

## Security, confidentiality, and passwords

Users must take all reasonable care to maintain the security of computing facilities and files to which they have been given access. In particular, users must not transfer or share their passwords, or rights to access or use computing facilities, with anyone else.

The confidentiality, integrity and security of all personally identifying data held, or processed on Prewired computing facilities must be respected, even where users have been authorised to access it.

Users must ensure that portable devices used to access Prewired information are protected by encryption, whether the device is owned by Prewired, is personally owned or belongs to a third party.

## Purpose and scope

Prewired is committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of children while using online services and digital platforms during our sessions. In line with Ofcom's recommendations and the UK's commitment to child online safety, this policy provides a framework for protecting children from harmful content, interactions, and experiences online.

The purpose of this policy is to:

* Safeguard childrenâ€™s personal data and privacy when engaging with digital platforms during our sessions;
* Protect children from exposure to inappropriate, harmful, or age-inappropriate content whilst using our equipment;
* Educate children, parents, and guardians on online safety risks; and
* Ensure all stakeholders understand their responsibilities in safeguarding children online.

This policy applies to:

* All online platforms, services, and tools used by Prewired that involve or are accessible to children; and
* All Prewired stakeholders working with children using digital platforms.

## Key principles

* **Risk Assessment**: Digital platforms, services, and apps used during our sessions are risk assessed on a regular basis with children's safety in mind, ensuring privacy settings, content controls, and communication features are appropriate for minors - please see Appendix for details.
* **Transparency**: Clear information is provided to children and their parents or guardians about the risks and responsibilities associated with using certain digital services through this policy and our thorough risk assessment.
* **Age-appropriate Content**: All content made available on digital platforms is regularly assessed to ensure it is suitable for children. Strict content moderation practices will be enforced for features that may pose a risk to children (for example, live chats, video calls).
* **Privacy and Data Protection**: Personal data collected from children are handled according to our [Privacy Policy](/privacy/) which follows the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018. Only necessary data are collected, stored securely, and used for specific, lawful purposes.
* **Digital Literacy Education**: Prewired will continue incorporating digital literacy education into its services to empower children with the knowledge they need to navigate the online world safely and responsibly. Children will be constantly educated about the importance of protecting their personal information, understanding online risks, and practicing respectful behaviour towards others. For this purpose, Prewired has been participating at the annual UK Safer Internet Day.
* **Parental Education**: We will offer resources, guides, and advice to parents and guardians on how to keep their children safe online, including how to use parental control features effectively (such as setting content filters, managing screen time, and tracking usage).
* **Reporting Mechanisms**: Clear and easily accessible reporting mechanisms are available for children, parents and guardians attending the sessions, and Prewired stakeholders to report incidents of online safety breaches or concerns including inappropriate content or behaviour (e.g., cyberbullying). These reports will be taken seriously and handled swiftly. Appropriate action will be taken based on the severity of the issue and may include educating the child, engaging with parents, or reporting to relevant authorities if necessary. All incidents, reports, and actions taken will be logged and monitored for future analysis and improvement. Please see our [Child Protection Policy](/child-protection/) about Incident Reporting.
* **Awareness**: All mentors receive regular training on safeguarding, child online safety, data protection regulations, and how to handle incidents involving children in digital spaces provided by our Child Protection Officer. We ensure the constant up to date knowledge of our Child Protection Officer by supporting them to participate in relevant courses and conferences (for example, The Fourth Annual Countering Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Conference 2023).
* **Designated Online Safety Adviser**: A designated Online Safety Adviser supports the Child Protection Officer with the implementation of the risk assessment and the ongoing monitoring of this policy, ensuring compliance with Ofcom guidelines and best practices.
* **Policy Review**: This policy will be reviewed annually to ensure it is up to date with the latest regulations, technological advancements, and emerging threats in the online safety landscape. We will actively seek feedback from children, parents, and stakeholders to continuously improve our online safety practices and ensure we are meeting the evolving needs of the online environment. If you have any questions or comments on this policy, please contact our Child Protection Officer: [cpo@prewired.org](mailto:cpo@prewired.org)

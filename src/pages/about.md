Many schools still do not offer appropriate computing classes, and curricula that do exist can be patchy. The technology industry is an ever growing one, and at the moment there are more software engineering (and similar) jobs in the world than there are people qualified to fill them. It would be terrible if gifted and enthusiastic young people were deterred from pursuing computing qualifications and roles because they were not aware of the opportunities available. We feel that this is too important and urgent to wait for schools to catch up.

But learning to code doesn't only qualify you to be a coder. As our world becomes increasingly technologically-oriented, understanding the process of creating the software that powers our daily lives becomes crucial for everyone. Becoming an empowered digital citizen â€” or professional in another industry â€” allows people to navigate their rights and responsibilities and make informed decisions about the products and services they use, or provide to others.

We think technology can help us towards a better world, but only if future generations understand the opportunities (and risks) it brings and the impact it can have.

## History

The University of Edinburghâ€™s School of Informatics first provided a local centre for the Young Rewired State annual week-long Festival of Code in 2012. In 2013, we entered three teams into the final competition of the Festival of Code and although they didn't win any prizes, they did brilliantly well. This experience, and the enthusiasm, knowledge, and ideas of the participants, inspired our founders&mdash;[Ewan Klein](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ewan/), [Freda O'Byrne](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/fredaobyrne), [Amy Guy](https://rhiaro.co.uk/), [Kit Barnes](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/kit-barnes-61288859), and [Stuart Anderson](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/soa/)&mdash;to pursue longer-term means of encouraging young people to engage with programming and related activities in Edinburgh.

Thus, Prewired (pre-Young Rewired State, get it?) was born, with these objectives:

* opening the eyes of young people to the possibilities presented by programming;
* supporting young people in experimenting with the technologies that seem interesting to them;
* guiding young people to resources for self-teaching, and towards best practices;
* providing an environment in which young people can safely engage with like-minded peers to work on projects of their own design, and can safely gain access to volunteering by adults from academia and industry; and
* encouraging idea generation, team building and pooling technical skills in preparation for higher education and the world of work.

The Prewired launch was held on the morning of 16<sup>th</sup> October 2013, in the University of Edinburghâ€™s Informatics Forum. 38 young people between the ages of 4 and 18 attended, while 15 volunteersâ€”university students, staff and local industry professionalsâ€”came along to help. Following on
from the launch, we held Prewired on a biweekly basis on Wednesday evenings in one of the School of Informatics computing labs in Appleton Tower. Despite minimal advertising, a devoted cohort of young people attended during 2013-14 on a regular basis, often accompanied by a parent, with numbers consistently in the 30&ndash;40 range.

In spring 2014, Prewired became affiliated with [CoderDojo](http://coderdojoscotland.com) (now CodeClub), part of a global collaboration that provides free coding clubs for young people. This year, Prewired also participated in the FIRST LEGO League for the first time, with our team *Zwired*.

In January 2015, faced with the imminent unavailability of Appleton Tower lab space due to refurbishment works, Prewired moved location to [CodeBase](http://thisiscodebase.com), a UK-leading tech incubator based in central Edinburgh, and due to the high level of demand from participants, began offering sessions on weekly basis. One benefit of the move was that staff from tech companies housed in CodeBase also started to offer volunteering support and since the move, our collective of volunteers has grown well beyond the University of Edinburgh.

A more detailed overview of the first few years of Prewired's running can be read in the ðŸ“„[First Prewired Report](/docs/First_Prewired_Report.pdf) from May 2015.

Young Rewired State unfortunately ceased to exist in 2016, so from that year, we started to provide our own alternative: the Prewired Summer Hack. For a full week, attendees worked in teams on a challenge often set by local organisations, such as Shelter Scotland, Civic Digits, or Skyscanner. Reports on each Summer Hack can be found in our [news archive](/news/). In September 2017, Prewired's move to independence was complete, when we registered as a Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation.

For several years, Prewired's weekly sessions and Summer Hacks at CodeBase thrived, until the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic forced the world to close down. In response, we [moved our sessions online](/news/2020-04-02-prewired-online/), organising through Discord. In 2021, we secured funding from Creative Informatics to launch an online-only initiative, Prewired++. As part of Prewired++, we hosted a special online version of the Summer Hack: the *Emporium of Digital Delights*, which ran for a series of three 12-day coding sprints.

Thankfully, in 2022, we were able to resume our in-person weekly sessions. Starting out small, with a few volunteers and attendees, much had to be rebuilt, but by 2023, we were back to full capacity and able to celebrate our 10-year anniversary looking back with pride. In that same year, we once again managed to run a hackathon - the first of our new Summer Make-a-Thons, which now run every year. In 2024, supported by a grant from Digital Xtra, we also returned to the FIRST LEGO League&mdash;and were immediately successful when one of our teams, *Plastic Pollution Solution*, won the prize for Best Innovation Project at the Edinburgh competition!

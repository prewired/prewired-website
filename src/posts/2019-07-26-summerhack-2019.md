We had an awesomely good Summer Hack 2019! It took place on July 22nd&ndash;26th 2019 at CodeBase, 38 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh.

Five teams created projects during the week &mdash; brief descriptions below.

## Project Descriptions

### The Bugs

Christina, Sarah, Cameron, Cole

> **Green Beans**: A game that uses a restaurant cooking scenario to raise awareness about sustainability and show people how they can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their everyday lives.
There is also a profit score to make it more realistic and to show how people can protect the environment without damaging their lifestyle.
It is a click-and-drag game, currently with three different meal options and two different upgrades.
